We've been talking with some really great people in our community who have worked hard at making a game like the one you see here.\n",
      "We want to make this project as fun and exciting as possible for everyone involved, including ourselves. That means creating beautiful content that's engaging but not just interesting (or so we hope) on all platforms: Steam Greenlight! And in case there is any question about how long it will take us before our next release?\n",
      "As of now, this project has been made and tested with over 300 players around the world. This includes both traditional fans as well many more who are working at indie developers or hobbyists that don't really play video games much but like to learn from some amazing folks! So you're sure not only have fun playing these new videos for your friends, they will also love what we've created here in a very cool and innovative way.\n",
