Other operating systems, especially the Linux derivatives, are adding kernel-tracing functionality as well. Still other operating systems are beginning to include performance and tracing tools fostered by research at various institutions, including the Paradyn project.\\n',\n",
       " '   In Figure 6.8, we illustrate a Pthread scheduling API.   The   pro- gram first determines the existing contention scope and sets it to PTHREAD SCOPE SYSTEM. It then creates five separate threads that will run using the SCS scheduling policy. Note that on some systems, only certain contention scope values are allowed. For example, Linux and Mac OS X systems allow only PTHREAD SCOPE SYSTEM.\\n',\n",
       " 'In the SCAN algorithm, the disk arm starts at one end of the disk and moves toward the other end, servicing requests as it reaches each cylinder, until it gets to the other end of the disk. At the other end, the direction of head movement is reversed, and servicing continues. The head continuously scans back and forth across the disk. The SCAN algorithm is sometimes called the elevator algorithm, since the disk arm behaves just like an elevator in a building, first servicing all the requests going up and then reversing to service requests the other way.\\n',\n",

Traditionally, techniques such as mutex locks, semaphores, and monitors have been used to address these issues, but as the number of processing cores increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to design multithreaded applications that are free from race conditions and deadlocks.\\n',\n",
       " '   It is easy to confuse TLS with local variables. However, local variables are visible only during a single function invocation, whereas TLS data are visible across function invocations. In some ways, TLS is similar to static data. The difference is that TLS data are unique to each thread. Most thread libraries  including Windows and Pthreads  provide some form of support for thread-local storage; Java provides support as well.\\n',\n",

For example, if 8 is passed as a parameter on the command line, the child process will output 8, 4, 2, 1. Because the parent and child processes have their own copies of the data, it will be necessary for the child to output the sequence. Have the parent invoke the wait() call to wait for the child process to complete before exiting the program. Perform necessary error checking to ensure that a positive integer is passed on the command line.\\n',\n",

Some file systems are general purpose, in that they can provide reasonable performance and functionality for a wide variety of file sizes, file types, and I/O loads. Others are optimized for specific tasks in an attempt to provide better performance in those areas than general-purpose file systems.

One reason live migration is possible is that most of the guests state is maintained within the guest for example, open file tables, system-call state, kernel state, and so on. Because disk I/O is so much slower than memory access, and used disk space is usually much larger than used memory, disks associated with the guest cannot be moved as part of a live migration. Rather, the disk must be remote to the guest, accessed over the network. In that case, disk access state is maintained within the guest, and network connections are all that matter to the VMM. The network connections are maintained during the migration, so remote disk access continues. Typically, NFS, CIFS, or iSCSI is used to store virtual machine images and any other storage a guest needs access to.

Recall that P1 has values of p1\\t50 and t1\\t25 and that P2 has values of p2\\t80 and t2\\t35. The EDF scheduling of these processes is shown in Figure 6.19. Process P1 has the earliest deadline, so its initial priority is higher than that of process P2. Process P2 begins running at the end of the CPU burst for P1. However, whereas rate-monotonic scheduling allows P1 to preempt P2 at the beginning of its next period at time 50, EDF scheduling allows process P2 to continue running. P2 now has a higher priority than P1 because its next deadline (at time 80) is earlier than that of P1 (at time 100). Thus, both P1 and P2 meet their first deadlines. Process P1 again begins running at time 60 and completes its second CPU burst at time 85, also meeting its second deadline at time 100. P2 begins running at this point, only to be preempted by P1 at the start of its next period at time 100. P2 is preempted because P1 has an earlier deadline (time 150) than P2 (time 160). At time 125, P1 completes its CPU burst and P2 resumes execution, finishing at time 145 and meeting its deadline as well. The system is idle until time 150, when P1 is scheduled to run once again. Unlike the rate-monotonic algorithm, EDF scheduling does not require that processes be periodic, nor must a process require a constant amount of CPU time per burst. The only requirement is that a process announce its deadline to the scheduler when it becomes runnable. The appeal of EDF scheduling is that it is theoretically optimal theoretically, it can schedule processes so that each process can meet its deadline requirements and CPU utilization will be 100 percent.

First, the user program can be terminated, with an appropriate error message. The user must then allocate more space and run the program again. These repeated runs may be costly. To prevent them, the user will normally overestimate the amount of space needed, resulting in considerable wasted space. The other possibility is to find a larger hole, copy the contents of the file to the new space, and release the previous space. This series of actions can be repeated as long as space exists, although it can be time consuming.

Second, binding can be done dynamically by a rendezvous mechanism. Typically, an operating system provides a rendezvous (also called a matchmaker) daemon on a fixed RPC port. A client then sends a message containing the name of the RPC to the rendezvous daemon requesting the port address of the RPC it needs to execute.

       " '    The separation of policy and mechanism is important for flexibility. Policies are likely to change across places or over time. In the worst case, each change in policy would require a change in the underlying mechanism. A general mechanism insensitive to changes in policy would be more desirable. A change in policy would then require redefinition of only certain parameters of the system. For instance, consider a mechanism for giving priority to certain types of programs over others. If the mechanism is properly separated from policy, it can be used either to support a policy decision that I/O-intensive programs should have priority over CPU-intensive ones or to support the opposite policy. Microkernel-based operating systems (Section 2.7.3) take the separation of mechanism and policy to one extreme by implementing a basic set of primitive building blocks. These blocks are almost policy free, allowing more advanced mechanisms and policies to be added via user-created kernel modules or user programs themselves. As an example, consider the history of UNIX. At first, it had a time-sharing scheduler. In the latest version of Solaris, scheduling is controlled by loadable tables. Depending on the table currently loaded, the system can be time sharing, batch processing, real time, fair share, or any combination. Making the scheduling mechanism general purpose allows vast policy changes to be made with a single load-new-table command. At the other extreme is a system such as Windows, in which both mechanism and policy are encoded in the system to enforce a global look and feel.

It is a faster file system because swap space is allocated in much larger blocks, and file lookups and indirect allocation methods are not used (Chapter 10). The system can therefore gain better paging throughput by copying an entire file image into the swap space at process startup and then performing demand paging from the swap space. Another option is to demand pages from the file system initially but to write the pages to swap space as they are replaced. This approach will ensure that only needed pages are read from the file system but that all subsequent paging is done from swap space.\\n',\n",

The previous pages are not likely to be used again and waste buffer space. With read-ahead, a requested page and several subsequent pages are read and cached. These pages are likely to be requested after the current page is processed. Retrieving these data from the disk in one transfer and caching them saves a considerable amount of time.

This instruction has an operand that identifies the desired kernel service. When a process executes the trap instruction, the interrupt hardware saves the state of the user code, switches to kernel mode, and dispatches to the kernel routine that implements the requested service. The trap is given a relatively low interrupt priority compared with those assigned to device interrupts executing a system call on behalf of an application is less urgent than servicing a device controller before its FIFO queue overflows and loses data.\\n',\n",

A process may be waiting for an I/O operation when we want to swap that process to free up memory. However, if the I/O is asynchronously accessing the user memory for I/O buffers, then the process cannot be swapped. Assume that the I/O operation is queued because the device is busy. If we were to swap out process P1 and swap in process P2, the I/O operation might then attempt to use memory that now belongs to process P2. There are two main solutions to this problem: never swap a process with pending I/O, or execute I/O operations only into operating-system buffers. Transfers between operating-system buffers and process memory then occur only when the process is swapped in. Note that this double buffering itself adds overhead. We now need to copy the data again, from kernel memory to user memory, before the user process can access it.\\n',\n",

The index root of a directory contains the top level of the B+ tree. For a large directory, this top level contains pointers to disk extents that hold the remainder of the tree. Each entry in the directory contains the name and file reference of the file, as well as a copy of the update timestamp and file size taken from the files resident attributes in the MFT.

Some CPUs implement separate instruction and data address TLBs. That can double the number of TLB entries available, because those lookups occur in different pipeline steps.

This anomaly results from the possibility of self-referencing (or a cycle) in the directory structure. In this case, we generally need to use a garbage collection scheme to determine when the last reference has been deleted and the disk space can be reallocated.

We can search for these links and remove them as well, but unless a list of the associated links is kept with each file, this search can be expensive. Alternatively, we can leave the links until an attempt is made to use them. At that time, we can determine that the file of the name given by the link does not exist and can fail to resolve the link name; the access is treated just as with any other illegal file name. (In this case, the system designer should consider carefully what to do when a file is deleted and another file of the same name is created, before a symbolic link to the original file is used.)

This block contains a pointer to the source of a transfer, a pointer to the destination of the transfer, and a count of the number of bytes to be transferred. The CPU writes the address of this command block to the DMA controller, then goes on with other work.

Many file systems apply changes to these structures in place. A typical operation, such as creating a file, can involve many structural changes within the file system on the disk. Directory structures are modified, FCBs are allocated, data blocks are allocated, and the free counts for all of these blocks are decreased. These changes can be interrupted by a crash, and inconsistencies among the structures can result. For example, the free FCB count might indicate that an FCB had been allocated, but the directory structure might not point to the FCB. Compounding this problem is the caching that operating systems do to optimize I/O performance. Some changes may go directly to disk, while others may be cached.

A bit, called the mode bit, is added to the hardware of the computer to indicate the current mode: kernel (0) or user (1). With the mode bit, we can distinguish between a task that is executed on behalf of the operating system and one that is executed on behalf of the user. When the computer system is executing on behalf of a user application, the system is in user mode. However, when a user application requests a service from the operating system (via a system call), the system must transition from user to kernel mode to fulfill the request.

       " '   A router is the communications processor within the computer network responsible for routing messages. A router can be a host computer with routing software or a special-purpose device. Either way, a router must have at least two network connections, or else it would have nowhere to route messages. A router decides whether any given message needs to be passed from the network on which it is received to any other network connected to the router. It makes this determination by examining the destination Internet address of the message. The router checks its tables to determine the location of the destination host, or at least of the network to which it will send the message toward the destination host. In the case of static routing, this table is changed only by manual update (a new file is loaded onto the router). With dynamic routing, a routing protocol is used between routers to inform them of network changes and to allow them to update their routing tables automatically.\\n',\n",
       " '    Still another issue is scalability the capability of a system to adapt to increased service load. Systems have bounded resources and can become completely saturated under increased load. For example, with respect to a file system, saturation occurs either when a servers CPU runs at a high utilization rate or when disks I/O requests overwhelm the I/O subsystem. Scalability is a relative property, but it can be measured accurately. A scalable system reacts more gracefully to increased load than does a nonscalable one. First, its performance degrades more moderately; and second, its resources reach a saturated state later. Even perfect design cannot accommodate an ever-growing load. Adding new resources might solve the problem, but it might generate additional indirect load on other resources (for example, adding machines to a distributed system can clog the network and increase service loads). Even worse, expanding the system can call for expensive design modifications. A scalable system should have the potential to grow without these problems. In a distributed system, the ability to scale up gracefully is of special importance, since expanding the network by adding new machines or interconnecting two networks is commonplace. In short, a scalable design should withstand high service load, accommodate growth of the user community, and allow simple integration of added resources.\\n',\n",

No I/O is needed in this case. When a page fault occurs, we first check whether the desired page is in the free-frame pool. If it is not, we must select a free frame and read into it. This technique is used in the VAX/VMS system along with a FIFO replace- ment algorithm.

Costly synchronous random writes to the file system are turned into much less costly synchronous sequential writes to the file systems journal.

For tasks at normal priority (nice values of 0), virtual run time is identical to actual physical run time.

Allocating memory involves determining the appropriate list and either taking the first free piece available on the list or allocating a new page and splitting it up. Memory regions claimed by the kmalloc() system are allocated permanently until they are freed explicitly with a corresponding call to kfree(); the kmalloc() system cannot reallocate or reclaim these regions in response to memory shortages.\\n',\n",

The media to carry networks are equally varied. They include copper wires, fiber strands, and wireless transmissions between satellites, microwave dishes, and radios. When computing devices are connected to cellular phones, they create a network. Even very short-range infrared communication can be used for networking. At a rudimentary level, whenever computers communicate, they use or create a network. These networks also vary in their performance\\n',\n",
       " 'When demand paging is used, we sometimes need to allow some of the pages to be locked in memory. One such situation occurs when I/O is done to or from user (virtual) memory. I/O is often implemented by a separate I/O processor. For example, a controller for a USB storage device is generally given the number of bytes to transfer and a memory address for the buffer (Figure 9.28). When the transfer is complete, the CPU is interrupted.\\n',\n",
       " 'processes. The mutex semaphore is used to ensure mutual exclusion when the variable read count is updated. The read count variable keeps track of how many processes are currently reading the object. The semaphore rw mutex functions as a mutual exclusion semaphore for the writers. It is also used by the first or last reader that enters or exits the critical section. It is not used by readers who enter or exit while other readers are in their critical sections.\\n',\n",
       " '   Because the disk head flies on an extremely thin cushion of air (measured in microns), there is a danger that the head will make contact with the disk surface. Although the disk platters are coated with a thin protective layer, the head will sometimes damage the magnetic surface. This accident is called a head crash.A head crash normally cannot be repaired; the entire disk must be replaced.\\n',\n",
       " '   An important variation on linked allocation is the use of a file-allocation table (FAT). This simple but efficient method of disk-space allocation was used by the MS-DOS operating system. A section of disk at the beginning of each volume is set aside to contain the table. The table has one entry for each disk block and is indexed by block number. The FAT is used in much the same way as a linked list. The directory entry contains the block number of the first block of the file. The table entry indexed by that block number contains the block number of the next block in the file. This chain continues until it reaches the last block, which has a special end-of-file value as the table entry. An unused block is indicated by a table value of 0. Allocating a new block to a file is a simple matter of finding the first 0-valued table entry and replacing the previous end-of-file value with the address of the new block. The 0 is then replaced with the end-of-file value. An illustrative example is the FAT structure shown in Figure 12.7 for a file consisting of disk blocks 217, 618, and 339.\\n',\n",
       " '   For thread synchronization outside the kernel, Windows provides dis- patcher objects. Using a dispatcher object, threads synchronize according to several different mechanisms, including mutex locks, semaphores, events, and timers. The system protects shared data by requiring a thread to gain ownership of a mutex to access the data and to release ownership when it is finished. Semaphores behave as described in Section 5.6. Events are similar to condition variables; that is, they may notify a waiting thread when a desired condition occurs. Finally, timers are used to notify one (or more than one) thread that a specified amount of time has expired.\\n',\n",
       " 'We have mentioned debugging frequently in this chapter. Here, we take a closer look. Broadly, debugging is the activity of finding and fixing errors in a system, both in hardware and in software. Performance problems are considered bugs, so debugging can also include performance tuning, which seeks to improve performance by removing processing bottlenecks. In this section, we explore debugging process and kernel errors and performance problems. Hardware debugging is outside the scope of this text.\\n',\n",
