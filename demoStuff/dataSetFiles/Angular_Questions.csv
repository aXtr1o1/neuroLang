What is Angular?,Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google. It is used to build single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.
What are the main features of Angular?,"Some of the key features include two-way data binding, dependency injection, modularity, component-based architecture, and RxJS integration"
What is the difference between AngularJS and Angular?,"AngularJS (version 1.x) is based on JavaScript, while Angular (version 2 and above) is based on TypeScript. Angular has a more modular architecture, improved performance, and better support for mobile development compared to AngularJS."
What are components in Angular?,"Components are the building blocks of an Angular application. They control a part of the UI and consist of an HTML template, a CSS stylesheet, and a TypeScript class that defines the component's behavior."
What is Angular CLI and how is it used?,"Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications. It provides commands for generating components, services, pipes, and for building, testing, and deploying applications."
What is a module in Angular?,"A module is a mechanism to group related components, directives, pipes, and services. Each Angular application has at least one module, the root module, defined in AppModule."
Explain the concept of Dependency Injection in Angular.,Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control). It allows a class to receive dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself. Angular’s DI system provides the ability to inject services into components and other services.
What are Angular services and how are they different from components?,"Services are classes that handle data logic and business operations. Unlike components, they do not manage the view (HTML). Services are typically used to share data and logic across multiple components."

What is a module in Angular?,"A module is a mechanism to group related components, directives, pipes, and services. Each Angular application has at least one module, the root module, defined in AppModule."
Explain the concept of Dependency Injection in Angular.,Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control). It allows a class to receive dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself. Angular’s DI system provides the ability to inject services into components and other services.
What are Angular services and how are they different from components?,"Services are classes that handle data logic and business operations. Unlike components, they do not manage the view (HTML). Services are typically used to share data and logic across multiple components."

What is RxJS and how is it used in Angular?,"RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for reactive programming using observables. Angular uses RxJS to handle asynchronous operations like HTTP requests, events, and more. Observables provide a powerful way to work with asynchronous data streams."
What are Angular directives?,"Angular directives are classes that add additional behavior to elements in your Angular applications. With Angular directives, you can manage forms, lists, styles, and what users see. There are three types of directives in Angular:
        - Component Directives: Directives with a template.
        - Structural Directives: Change the DOM layout by adding and removing elements (e.g., *ngIf, *ngFor).
        - Attribute Directives: Change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive (e.g., ngClass, ngStyle)."
What is Angular Universal?,"Angular Universal is a technology that allows server-side rendering (SSR) for Angular applications. SSR generates the static application pages on the server instead of the client, improving performance and SEO (Search Engine Optimization). It can significantly improve the load time of the first page, enhance the SEO by making content available for search engines, and provide better user experience for users with slow internet connections."
How does Angular's Change Detection mechanism work?,"Angular's Change Detection mechanism is responsible for updating the view whenever the application state changes. It uses a tree of components to track changes, and it runs after any asynchronous event (such as a user event, timer, or HTTP request) to determine if the model has changed. Angular uses two change detection strategies:
        - Default: Angular checks the entire component tree to detect changes.
        - OnPush: Angular only checks the component and its children when an input reference changes or an event originates from the component or its children.
        This allows Angular to efficiently update the user interface while minimizing performance overhead."
What is Angular Routing?,"Angular Routing is a feature that allows you to navigate between different views or pages in a single-page application. It uses the Angular Router module to map URLs to components. You can define routes in an Angular module and associate them with specific components, allowing for navigation between these components based on the application's URL. Angular Router also supports features like lazy loading, route guards, and parameterized routes."
What is a Resolver in Angular?,"A Resolver in Angular is a service that pre-fetches data before navigating to a route. Resolvers are used in the Angular Router to ensure that the necessary data is available before the route is activated. This is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to load data from a server before displaying a component. Resolvers are defined in the route configuration and can return an Observable, Promise, or static data."
How do Angular Pipes work?,"Angular Pipes are a way to transform data directly in the template. They are used to format data before displaying it in the view. Angular comes with several built-in pipes, such as DatePipe, UpperCasePipe, LowerCasePipe, CurrencyPipe, and PercentPipe. You can also create custom pipes to handle specific transformation logic. Pipes are implemented as classes with a transform method that takes the input value and optional parameters, and returns the transformed value."
What are Angular lifecycle hooks?,"Angular lifecycle hooks are special methods that provide visibility into key moments in a component's or directive's life. These hooks allow developers to run custom logic at various stages of the lifecycle. Some of the commonly used lifecycle hooks include:
        - ngOnInit: Called once after the first ngOnChanges.
        - ngOnChanges: Called whenever data-bound input properties change.
        - ngDoCheck: Called during every change detection run.
        - ngAfterContentInit: Called once after the first ngDoCheck.
        - ngAfterContentChecked: Called after ngAfterContentInit and every subsequent ngDoCheck.
        - ngAfterViewInit: Called once after the first ngAfterContentChecked.
        - ngAfterViewChecked: Called after ngAfterViewInit and every subsequent ngAfterContentChecked.
        - ngOnDestroy: Called just before the component is destroyed."
What is the purpose of NgZone in Angular?,"NgZone in Angular is a service that helps manage and optimize change detection. It provides a mechanism to run certain code outside of the Angular zone and then re-enter the Angular zone to trigger change detection when necessary. This is useful for improving performance by reducing the number of times Angular checks for changes. For example, you can use NgZone to run heavy computations or external libraries that do not need to trigger change detection, and then manually trigger change detection when the computation is complete."
How does Angular handle error handling?,"Angular handles error handling through several mechanisms:
        - Global Error Handling: Using the ErrorHandler class, you can implement a global error handling strategy by providing a custom ErrorHandler class.
        - Try-Catch Blocks: For synchronous code, you can use try-catch blocks to catch and handle errors.
        - HTTP Interceptors: For handling errors in HTTP requests, you can use HTTP interceptors to intercept and handle HTTP errors globally.
        - RxJS CatchError: For handling errors in Observables, you can use the catchError operator from RxJS to handle errors and provide fallback logic.
        These mechanisms help ensure that errors are properly handled and that the application can recover gracefully from unexpected issues."
What is Angular Ivy?,"Angular Ivy is the default rendering engine for Angular as of version 9. Ivy aims to improve the performance and size of Angular applications. It uses a new incremental DOM, which allows for faster rendering and smaller bundle sizes. Ivy also enhances template type checking, enabling better error detection during development. One of Ivy's key features is its ability to support AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation and dynamic loading of components."
How do you create and use a custom decorator in Angular?,"Angular Guards are used to control navigation and access to certain routes in an Angular application. There are several types of guards:
        - CanActivate: Determines if a route can be activated.
        - CanActivateChild: Determines if children routes of a route can be activated.
        - CanDeactivate: Determines if a route can be deactivated.
        - CanLoad: Prevents asynchronous routing by checking if a module can be loaded.
        Guards are implemented as services and can contain logic to allow or deny access based on conditions like user authentication, permissions, etc."
What are Angular Animations and how are they implemented?,"Angular DI (Dependency Injection) is a design pattern and a fundamental aspect of Angular. It allows you to inject dependencies (services or objects) into a class without creating them within the class itself. DI helps in creating modular, maintainable, and testable code by promoting loose coupling between components. Angular's DI system provides a hierarchical injector that creates and manages instances of objects and resolves their dependencies. This ensures that classes are provided with the dependencies they need, facilitating modular and scalable application development."
What is Angular Lazy Loading?,"Angular provides built-in support for internationalization (i18n), allowing developers to create multilingual applications. Angular's i18n features enable the translation of text and localization of formats such as dates, numbers, and currencies. Key features include:
        - Template Internationalization: Using Angular's i18n syntax within templates to mark translatable text and placeholders.
        - AOT (Ahead-of-Time) Compilation: Allows translations to be applied during the build process, reducing runtime overhead.
        - Localization with ICU (International Components for Unicode): Supports pluralization, gender agreement, and more complex translation scenarios.
        - Externalization of Translations: Allows translations to be stored in external files and loaded dynamically at runtime.
        Angular's i18n capabilities enable developers to create applications that cater to global audiences by supporting multiple languages and cultural conventions."
What is the purpose of the async pipe in Angular?,"Angular interceptors are middleware functions that can be used to intercept incoming and outgoing HTTP requests and responses. They provide a way to modify or handle HTTP requests globally within an Angular application. Interceptors are typically used for tasks such as logging HTTP interactions, adding headers, handling errors, and modifying responses. They are defined as classes that implement the HttpInterceptor interface and are registered within the Angular module's providers array."
How do you implement form validation in Angular?,"Angular's HttpClient is a powerful tool for making HTTP requests in Angular applications. It simplifies the process of communicating with a backend server or external APIs by providing methods like get, post, put, delete, etc., for HTTP operations. HttpClient also supports features such as JSON parsing, error handling, interceptors, and type-checking of responses. It is based on observables and integrates seamlessly with Angular's reactive programming style, making it easy to handle asynchronous data streams."
What are Angular Guards?,Angular's ng-container is a grouping element in Angular templates that does not interfere with styles or layout. It is used primarily to provide structure to the template without adding extra elements to the DOM. ng-container is useful in scenarios where you want to apply structural directives like *ngIf and *ngFor to a block of HTML elements without introducing an additional wrapper element. It allows you to keep the template clean and maintainable while still benefiting from Angular's powerful structural directive capabilities.
What is Angular DI (Dependency Injection) and why is it important?,"Angular services are classes that are used to organize and share code across the application. They provide a way to centralize data and logic that can be shared across multiple components. Services in Angular are typically used for tasks such as fetching data from a server, logging messages, performing calculations, or any other functionality that doesn't belong in a component. Services are decorated with @Injectable() and registered with Angular's dependency injection system, allowing them to be injected into components, directives, or other services."
How does Angular handle internationalization (i18n)?,"Angular directives are markers on a DOM element that tell Angular to attach a specified behavior to that element or transform the DOM layout. There are three types of directives in Angular:
        - Component Directives: Directives with templates that are used as custom HTML elements.
        - Structural Directives: Directives that alter the DOM's layout by adding, removing, or manipulating elements.
        - Attribute Directives: Directives that alter the appearance or behavior of an existing element or component.
        Directives are a powerful feature in Angular that allows you to extend HTML's capabilities and create reusable components and behaviors. Example of directives include *ngIf, *ngFor, and custom directives created using @Directive decorator."
What are Angular interceptors and how are they used?,"Angular Ivy is the latest rendering engine for Angular applications introduced in version 9. Ivy improves application performance by generating more efficient code, reducing bundle size, and speeding up compilation and rendering processes. It achieves this by optimizing the way Angular components are compiled and executed, enabling better tree-shaking and enabling features like AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation and differential loading."
Explain Angular's HttpClient and its advantages.,"Angular forms are a mechanism to handle user inputs and validations in Angular applications. There are two types of forms in Angular: Template-driven forms and Reactive forms.
        - Template-driven forms: These forms are defined within the HTML template using directives such as ngModel for data binding and ngForm for form submission and validation.
        - Reactive forms: These forms are defined programmatically in the component class using FormBuilder and FormGroup. They offer more control over form validation and data handling, making them suitable for complex scenarios and dynamic forms.
        Both types of forms support features like validation, error handling, custom form controls, and integration with Angular's change detection."
What is Angular's ng-container used for?,"Angular supports lazy loading of modules to improve application startup time and reduce initial bundle size. Lazy loading allows Angular to load modules asynchronously when they are needed, rather than loading everything upfront. This is achieved by defining routes with loadChildren property in the routing configuration. When a user navigates to a lazy-loaded route, Angular dynamically fetches the corresponding module and injects it into the application. This approach helps in optimizing performance by loading only essential modules upfront and deferring the loading of less frequently used modules until they are required."
What are Angular services and why are they used?,"Angular NgZone is a service provided by Angular that helps manage the execution context in which Angular runs. It provides a way to explicitly run code outside of Angular's zone or to be notified when code runs inside or outside of Angular's zone. NgZone is particularly useful for optimizing performance and handling asynchronous operations that might trigger change detection in Angular applications. By default, Angular components and services run inside NgZone, ensuring that changes to data trigger Angular's change detection mechanisms."
Explain Angular directives and provide examples.,"Angular's NgModule is a decorator that is used to define a module in an Angular application. Modules in Angular help organize the application into cohesive blocks of functionality. They group related components, directives, services, and pipes together and define how they interact with each other. NgModule also configures the compiler and runtime behavior of the application. It allows you to declare components, import other modules, provide services, and export components, directives, and pipes for use in other parts of the application."
How does Angular handle HTTP error handling?,"Angular's Change Detection mechanism is responsible for detecting changes to application state and updating the view accordingly. Change detection in Angular uses a unidirectional tree structure where components are arranged in a hierarchy. When data in a component changes, Angular propagates these changes downward through the component tree and updates the affected parts of the view. Angular's change detection strategy is optimized to minimize unnecessary DOM manipulations, ensuring efficient performance even in complex applications."
What is Angular Ivy and how does it improve application performance?,"Angular provides several mechanisms for component communication:
        - Input and Output Properties: Components can communicate by passing data using input properties (parent to child communication) and emitting events using output properties (child to parent communication).
        - Services: Components can share data and communicate indirectly through services, which act as intermediaries to manage and share data between components.
        - @ViewChild and @ContentChild: These decorators allow parent components to access child components or their elements directly and interact with them programmatically.
        - RxJS Observables: Components can use observables to establish communication channels and pass data asynchronously between components or services.
        These communication mechanisms enable building scalable and maintainable Angular applications."
Explain the concept of Angular forms and their types.,"Angular lifecycle hooks are methods that Angular calls at certain points in the lifecycle of a component or directive. They allow you to tap into key moments in the component's lifecycle and take action, such as initializing data, performing cleanup, or reacting to changes. Some of the commonly used lifecycle hooks include ngOnInit, ngOnChanges, ngOnDestroy, and ngAfterViewInit. By implementing these hooks in your component or directive, you can control its behavior and integrate it seamlessly into the application's lifecycle."
How does Angular support lazy loading of modules?,"Angular's dependency injection (DI) system is a design pattern and a fundamental aspect of Angular architecture. DI is used to manage the dependencies of components, services, and other objects within an Angular application. It allows you to define dependencies in a hierarchical injector tree and inject them into components or services as needed. DI promotes loose coupling between classes, improves code reusability, and facilitates testing by enabling the use of mock dependencies. Angular's DI system is configured using providers, which specify how dependencies are instantiated and injected throughout the application."
What is Angular NgZone and why is it used?,"Angular provides several built-in security features to protect applications against common vulnerabilities and attacks:
        - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Protection: Angular automatically sanitizes user input and escapes potentially dangerous content to prevent XSS attacks.
        - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection: Angular provides mechanisms to include CSRF tokens in HTTP requests and verify their validity on the server to prevent CSRF attacks.
        - Content Security Policy (CSP) Support: Angular supports configuring CSP headers to define policies for controlling the sources from which content can be loaded, enhancing application security.
        - Secure Authentication and Authorization: Angular integrates seamlessly with authentication mechanisms such as OAuth and provides guards and interceptors to enforce access control and protect routes."
Explain Angular pipes and give examples of their usage.,"Angular directives are markers on a DOM element that tell Angular to attach a specified behavior to that element or transform the DOM layout. Directives can be classified into three types: components, attribute directives, and structural directives. Components are directives with templates that define views. Attribute directives alter the appearance or behavior of an element, while structural directives alter the DOM layout by adding, removing, or manipulating elements. Components are a specific type of directive that always have a template."
How does Angular support server-side rendering (SSR)?,"Angular's view encapsulation is a mechanism that defines how the styles defined in a component affect the DOM elements within that component's view. View encapsulation ensures that styles defined in a component's styleUrls or inline styles only affect the component's template and don't leak into other components or the global scope. This helps in maintaining component isolation and preventing style conflicts in large applications. Angular provides three types of view encapsulation: Emulated (default), Shadow DOM, and None, each offering different levels of style isolation."
What is Angular's NgModule and how is it used?,"Angular handles routing and navigation using the Angular Router module, which provides a powerful mechanism for navigating between different views (components) in a single-page application. Angular Router allows you to define navigation paths, configure route parameters, guard routes, and handle lazy loading of modules. Navigation in Angular is achieved by defining routes in a RouterModule and using routerLink directives in templates to navigate between views based on defined route paths. Angular Router also supports features like route resolvers, nested routes, and route guards to enhance navigation control and security."
Explain Angular's Change Detection mechanism.,"Angular services are classes that are responsible for encapsulating reusable logic and data manipulation across an Angular application. They are used to share data and functionality across components and other services without duplicating code. Services in Angular are typically singleton instances created once and shared across the application. They are registered in Angular's dependency injection system and can be injected into components, directives, or other services. In contrast, components in Angular are building blocks of UI elements that are responsible for presenting data and responding to user interactions."
How does Angular handle component communication?,"Angular Material is a UI component library for Angular applications that implements Google's Material Design specification. It provides a set of reusable and accessible UI components such as buttons, cards, menus, dialogs, and form controls. Angular Material helps developers quickly build modern and responsive user interfaces with consistent design patterns and accessibility features. It integrates seamlessly with Angular applications and can be customized to match specific design requirements."
What are Angular lifecycle hooks and how are they used?,"Angular's TestBed is a utility provided by Angular's testing framework (e.g., TestBed from @angular/core/testing) that facilitates unit testing of Angular components, services, and directives. TestBed creates a testing module environment that replicates an Angular module configuration, allowing you to configure dependencies, inject services, and compile components for testing purposes. TestBed provides methods like configureTestingModule and createComponent for configuring and instantiating components within a test environment. This helps in isolating and testing components in a controlled environment, ensuring their functionality and behavior meet expectations."
Explain Angular's dependency injection system.,"Angular's dependency injection (DI) system allows for hierarchical injection across multiple modules in an Angular application. When modules are imported into other modules, Angular's DI system merges all providers (services, tokens) into a single dependency injection tree. This means that services provided in one module can be injected into components or services defined in other modules that import it. Angular ensures that dependencies are resolved correctly based on the hierarchy of modules and providers, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability of Angular applications."
How does Angular handle security features?,"In Angular, the ngOnInit lifecycle hook is called after Angular has initialized all data-bound properties of a directive. It is typically used to perform initialization logic such as fetching data from a backend service or initializing complex state. On the other hand, the constructor is a TypeScript feature that is called when an instance of a class is created. In Angular components, the constructor is primarily used for dependency injection and basic initialization, but it should not be used for complex logic that relies on component bindings or input properties."
What are Angular directives and how are they different from components?,"Angular directives are a powerful feature that allows you to extend HTML's capabilities and create reusable components and behaviors. Directives in Angular can be categorized into three types: component directives, attribute directives, and structural directives. Component directives are directives with templates that define views, attribute directives alter the behavior or appearance of an element, and structural directives alter the DOM layout by adding, removing, or manipulating elements based on conditions. Examples of Angular directives include *ngIf, *ngFor, and custom directives created using @Directive decorator."
Explain Angular's view encapsulation and its importance.,Angular's change detection mechanism is responsible for detecting changes in the application state and updating the DOM to reflect those changes. Angular uses a unidirectional tree structure where changes in a component trigger change detection that propagates downward through the component tree. Angular's change detection strategy is optimized to minimize DOM updates by tracking changes and only updating the parts of the DOM that have changed. This ensures efficient performance even in complex applications with large component trees.
How does Angular handle routing and navigation?,"Angular guards are interfaces that can be implemented to control navigation and access to routes in an Angular application. There are several types of guards: CanActivate, CanActivateChild, CanDeactivate, and CanLoad. Guards are used to enforce authentication, permissions, and other conditions before allowing a user to navigate to a specific route. They are implemented as services and can be attached to routes in the routing configuration to protect routes from unauthorized access."
What are Angular services and how are they different from components?,"Angular's Ahead-of-Time (AoT) compilation is a process where Angular compiles application code and templates during the build phase, before the browser downloads and runs the application. AoT compilation converts TypeScript and HTML code into efficient JavaScript code that the browser can execute directly, without the need for Angular's runtime compiler in the final bundle. This results in smaller bundle sizes, faster startup times, and improved application performance compared to Just-in-Time (JiT) compilation, which compiles templates in the browser at runtime."
Explain the concept of Angular pipes and provide examples of their usage.,"Angular supports internationalization (i18n) to create applications that can be easily adapted to different languages and locales. Angular's i18n features enable developers to internationalize their applications by externalizing and translating text, formatting dates, numbers, and currencies according to different locales. Angular's i18n support includes tools for extracting translatable text from templates, generating translation files, and integrating translated content back into the application. It also supports ICU (International Components for Unicode) messages for advanced pluralization and gender-specific translations."
How does Angular handle lazy loading of modules?,"Angular modules are containers for a cohesive block of code in an Angular application. They help organize the application into logical units by grouping related components, directives, services, and pipes. Each module defines its scope, dependencies, and configuration, promoting modularity and maintainability. Angular modules are defined using the @NgModule decorator and can import other modules to use their functionalities, making the application scalable and easier to manage."
What is Angular Material and how does it enhance Angular applications?,"Angular handles data binding through various mechanisms that allow the synchronization of data between the model and the view. The main types of data binding in Angular are:
        - Interpolation ({{ expression }}): Binds data from the component class to the template.
        - Property Binding ([property]=""expression""): Binds data to properties of DOM elements.
        - Event Binding ((event)=""expression""): Binds DOM events to component methods.
        - Two-way Binding [(ngModel)]=""expression"": Binds data between the component and the template, enabling two-way communication.
        These data binding techniques facilitate seamless interaction between the UI and application data."
Explain Angular's TestBed and its role in testing Angular components.,"Dependency injection (DI) in Angular is a design pattern that allows the efficient and modular provision of dependencies to components and services. DI promotes loose coupling, enhances code reusability, and simplifies testing by allowing the injection of dependencies rather than hardcoding them. Angular's DI system uses providers to define how dependencies are created and managed. Components and services declare their dependencies, and Angular's injector resolves and supplies these dependencies at runtime, ensuring that the components have all the required resources to function correctly."
How does Angular handle dependency injection across multiple modules?,"Angular interceptors are middleware that allow you to intercept HTTP requests and responses globally within an Angular application. They provide a way to handle cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, error handling, and caching. Interceptors are implemented as classes that implement the HttpInterceptor interface and can modify outgoing requests or incoming responses before passing them along the request chain. They are registered in the Angular module's providers array and provide a centralized way to apply common logic to HTTP requests."
What are the key differences between ngOnInit and constructor in Angular components?,"Angular services are classes that are responsible for encapsulating reusable logic and data manipulation across an Angular application.

They can be attributes, structural, or components. Directives are used to create reusable components and attach certain behavior to an element."
Explain Angular's AoT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation and its benefits.,"NgRx is a popular library for Angular applications that provides state management inspired by Redux. It allows developers to manage application state in a predictable way using actions, reducers, selectors, and effects. NgRx facilitates a unidirectional data flow and helps manage complex state logic in large-scale applications by enforcing immutability and providing tools for debugging and time-traveling debugging."
How does Angular support internationalization (i18n)?,"Angular's module system allows developers to organize an application into cohesive blocks of functionality. Modules in Angular are defined using the @NgModule decorator and provide a way to group components, directives, pipes, and services that are related to specific functionality or feature sets. Modules can import other modules to use their functionality and export components, directives, and pipes for use in other parts of the application. This modular approach promotes reusability, maintainability, and scalability of Angular applications."
What are Angular modules and how do they contribute to application structure?,"Angular's ViewChild is a decorator that allows a parent component to access a child component, directive, or element in its template. ViewChild is used to obtain a reference to a child component or element and interact with it programmatically. It is commonly used for scenarios such as accessing child component methods, properties, or DOM elements from the parent component."
How does Angular handle data binding and what are its types?,"Angular provides robust error handling mechanisms to manage and report errors that occur during application execution. Error handling in Angular includes:
        - Try-catch blocks: JavaScript's native error handling mechanism can be used within TypeScript code to catch and handle errors locally.
        - Global error handling: Angular allows you to define global error handling using ErrorHandler class to intercept unhandled exceptions and manage them centrally.
        - HTTP error handling: Angular's HttpClient module provides mechanisms to handle errors that occur during HTTP requests, such as retrying requests, handling specific error codes, and logging errors.
        - Custom error handling: Developers can implement custom error handling strategies by extending Angular's error handling mechanisms and integrating with third-party error reporting services."
Explain the concept of dependency injection in Angular and its advantages.,"Angular's dependency injection (DI) system facilitates the efficient management and injection of dependencies across multiple modules in an Angular application. When modules are imported into other modules, Angular's DI system merges all providers (services, tokens) into a single dependency injection tree. This enables components, services, and other classes to declare their dependencies and have them resolved and injected automatically by Angular's injector.
