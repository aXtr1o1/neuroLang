	"Some of the key features include two-way data binding, dependency injection, modularity, component-based architecture, and RxJS integration",
	"AngularJS (version 1.x) is based on JavaScript, while Angular (version 2 and above) is based on TypeScript. Angular has a more modular architecture, improved performance, and better support for mobile development compared to AngularJS.",
	"Components are the building blocks of an Angular application. They control a part of the UI and consist of an HTML template, a CSS stylesheet, and a TypeScript class that defines the component's behavior.",
	"Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool to initialize, develop, scaffold, and maintain Angular applications. It provides commands for generating components, services, pipes, and for building, testing, and deploying applications.",
	"A module is a mechanism to group related components, directives, pipes, and services. Each Angular application has at least one module, the root module, defined in AppModule.",
	"Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control). It allows a class to receive dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself. Angular’s DI system provides the ability to inject services into components and other services.",
	"Services are classes that handle data logic and business operations. Unlike components, they do not manage the view (HTML). Services are typically used to share data and logic across multiple components.",
	"Angular supports two approaches for forms: Template-driven and Reactive forms. Template-driven forms are simpler and suitable for small forms, while Reactive forms provide more control and are better for complex and dynamic forms.",
	"RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for reactive programming using observables. Angular uses RxJS to handle asynchronous operations like HTTP requests, events, and more. Observables provide a powerful way to work with asynchronous data streams.",
	"Angular is a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google. It is used to build single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.
