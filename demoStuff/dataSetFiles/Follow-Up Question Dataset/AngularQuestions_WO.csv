How does data binding work in Angular? Explain the different types of data binding (one-way vs. two-way).,"Data binding in Angular automatically synchronizes data between the component's logic (TypeScript) and the view (HTML template). When data in the component changes, Angular reflects those changes in the view, and vice versa. There are two main types:  One-way data binding: Data flows from the component to the view, and changes in the view are not automatically reflected back in the component.  Two-way data binding: Changes in the view are automatically propagated back to the component, keeping both the view and component data in sync."
Explain the concept of dependency injection in Angular. How does it promote loose coupling?,"Dependency injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows you to provide dependencies (services, objects) to a component or service at runtime rather than hardcoding them. This promotes loose coupling, meaning components rely on abstractions (interfaces) instead of concrete implementations. This makes code easier to test, maintain, and reuse since components don't depend on specific implementations but rather on the functionality provided by the dependency."
Describe the concept of change detection in Angular. How does it affect performance optimization?,"Change detection is Angular's mechanism for keeping the view in sync with the component's data. It automatically detects changes in the component's data and updates the view accordingly.  Change detection strategies can be used to optimize performance. For example, the `OnPush` strategy only triggers change detection when an event or user interaction occurs, preventing unnecessary updates."
